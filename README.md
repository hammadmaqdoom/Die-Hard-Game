# Die-Hard-Game

# Overview
Built a game in C++ using SDL Library for course project 'CS224: Object Oriented Programming & Design Methodologies' at Habib University.

# Tasks
Some features of game are as follows:
-  welcome screen: presents startup options about game.
- Gameplay consists of several objects.
- Background and other sounds are added to the game.
- The concepts learned in the course are applied in game e.g. operator overloading, static functions, const functions, Inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
- The game creates objects dynamically during its play, and proper memory management is shown in the game.
- std containers (list, vector, etc… ) are used to store the object pointers created dynamically.
